Unofficial OpenJDK LTS patches for Linux/sparc64
---

These are patches that I collected from various sources to make OpenJDK
builds on a Linux/sparc64 system.

The patch files are named with the format `jdk[version]-[ordering]-[description].patch`.
The files should be applied in the correct ordering (that is, jdkXX-01-YYYY.patch
should be applied before jdkXX-02-YYYY.patch, and so on).
